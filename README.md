# One Time Password

Using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SAM, S3 to create and send an OTP via email to user. The app will then display a simple React app if the OTP is correct.

NOTE: This is NOT production code. This is more or less a POC. OTP can clearly be seen in the payload. In production code, OTP should be generated on the back end (Lambda) and a token sent to the user. The design decision was due to a 5 hour hard stop limit.
